# Movie-Recommendation-System
**Project Overview**

A movie recommendation system is a software application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. This project aims to develop such a system using Python and machine learning algorithms.

**Key Components and Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   * Gather a comprehensive dataset of movie ratings and metadata (e.g., genre, popularity, runtime).
   * Datasets includes budget and vote count.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
   * Normalize or standardize numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Create new features that might be relevant for recommendations.
   * Consider factors like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

4. **Recommendation Generation:**
   * Implement a system that takes user input (e.g., movie ratings, preferences) and generates personalized recommendations.
   * Consider factors like user history, similarity to other users, and movie content.

**Python Libraries and Tools:**

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive machine learning library.
* **Surprise:** A Python library specifically designed for collaborative filtering.
* **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** For deep learning approaches (if applicable).
